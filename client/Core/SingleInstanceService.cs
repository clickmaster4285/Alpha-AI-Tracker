/// process owns the global mutex, runs all collection/sync services, and keeps
/// a hidden window + tray icon alive so closing the window does not stop
/// tracking.
///
/// When the user launches the app a SECOND time (e.g. clicks the desktop
/// entry while the background instance is already running), the mutex is
/// already held. Instead of exiting silently — which made the GUI "open and
/// instantly close" — the second launch sends a SHOW signal to the running
/// instance via a named pipe. The running instance then brings its window to
/// the front. This lets the user open/close the GUI any number of times
/// without ever stopping the background tracking.
