# Workflow

How work actually moves through this repo — the loops you run daily, and the gates a change has to clear before it counts as done.

Rules live in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) §6; this file is the *procedure* for obeying them. File locations: [FILE_HIERARCHY.md](./FILE_HIERARCHY.md).

*Last audited: 2026-08-10 — commands verified against `client/publish/*.sh`, `server/Makefile`, `web/package.json`.*

## 0. The one rule that shapes every workflow below

> **`dotnet run` is not a release test.** It compiles from the source tree, so it can never catch a packaging gap. The installed app runs from a root-owned directory with only what the `publish/*` scripts bundled. **A client change is not done until it works from an installed build.**

Everything in §1 is the fast loop. Everything in §5 is the loop that decides whether the change is real.

---

## 1. Daily dev loop

Three services, three terminals. Start them in this order — the client needs the server, the web console needs the server.

### Infrastructure

```bash
# Postgres + Redis must be up first (see AGENTS.md §8 for connection details)
```

### Server

```bash
cd server
make setup          # first time only: .env from example, deps, build
make run            # build + run
make dev            # hot reload (needs: go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest)
make test           # go test ./... -v -count=1
```

Schema changes are **append-only**: add `017_<name>.sql` to `server/migrations/`, never edit an applied file.

### Web

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev         # next dev
npm run build       # production build — run before claiming a page works
npm run lint
```

> **Web list pages MUST use server-side infinite scroll** (`useInfiniteQuery` + IntersectionObserver
> sentinel). Next/Previous buttons are forbidden — see AGENTS.md §6 *Web Infinite-Scroll Rule* and
> `web/ARCHITECTURE.md` §4. Reference: `web/src/app/(app)/employees/page.tsx`.

> **GPS / Location pages** (`/gps-location`, `/employee-journey/location`) show a Coming Soon shell
> while `web/src/lib/locationUi.ts` has `LOCATION_UI_ENABLED=false`. Live UI lives in
> `GpsLocationLive.tsx` / `LocationTrailLive.tsx` — set the flag to `true` to re-enable. Client
> collectors and server sync APIs are unchanged.

### Client

```bash
cd client
dotnet build        # compile check
dotnet run          # fast iteration ONLY — see §0
```

`dotnet run` is right for: XAML layout, binding wiring, VM logic, collector behaviour on your own machine. It is wrong for: anything involving a new file on disk, a config value, a path, or an installer.

---

## 2. Re-brand or bump the version

Two files. Nothing else.

```bash
cd client
$EDITOR APP_IDENTIFIERS     # DISPLAY_NAME, PUBLISHER, PACKAGE_NAME, BUNDLE_ID, APP_URL, …
$EDITOR VERSION             # e.g. 0.2.0 → 0.3.0

dotnet clean                # REQUIRED — VERSION is read at project-evaluation time and cached
bash publish/build-installer.sh -b linux
```

**Why `dotnet clean`:** `client.csproj` reads `VERSION` when the project graph is *evaluated*, not in a `BeforeBuild` target. That is deliberate — a target-based read leaves IDE design-time builds silently stamping `1.0.0`. The cost is that an incremental build reuses the cached graph, so an edited `VERSION` needs a clean.

**What updates automatically:** window title, splash, rail wordmark and initials, footers, tray tooltip and menu, log banners (all via `Core/AppInfo`), plus `.deb` package name, `.dmg` bundle id, Windows installer strings and every artifact filename (all via the build scripts sourcing the same two files).

**What must NOT change:** `Core/EncryptedConfigService.cs` — `TransportKeySeed` and `MachineKeyPrefix` look like brand strings but are cryptographic KDF seeds. Templatizing them makes every `config.enc` already deployed in the field undecryptable.

**Acceptance:** install the artifact and confirm the six surfaces above changed with **zero other source edits**. If you had to touch a third file, the single-source guarantee has regressed — fix that, not the symptom.

---

## 3. Add a GUI page

Full detail in [client/UI_ARCHITECTURE.md](./client/UI_ARCHITECTURE.md) §7. The shape:

1. `ViewModels/YourPageViewModel.cs` — `ViewModelBase`, `[ObservableProperty]` state, one `[RelayCommand] RefreshAsync(CancellationToken)` guarded by `IsBusy`.
2. `Program.cs` — `AddTransient<YourPageViewModel>()`; take it in `MainViewModel`'s constructor, expose as `{ get; }`.
3. `MainViewModel` — add to `AppPage`, add `IsYourPage`, list it in the `[NotifyPropertyChangedFor]` block on `_activePage`, and add its arm to `NavigateAsync` / `RefreshActivePageAsync` / `ActivePageTitle` / `ActivePageSubtitle`.
4. `Views/Pages/YourPage.axaml` — `x:DataType`, root `Border Classes="page-in"`, composed from existing style classes. New icon → a `StreamGeometry` in `Styles/AppTheme.xaml`.
5. `MainWindow.axaml` — one rail `Button Classes="nav" Classes.active="{Binding IsYourPage}"`, one host entry using the `$parent[Window].((vm:MainViewModel)DataContext).IsYourPage` visibility pattern.
6. Ship-test (§5).

Anything under `Assets/` — including new hero images — is compiled in by the existing `<AvaloniaResource Include="Assets\**" />` glob and needs **no** installer change.

---

## 4. Add a runtime asset, script, or config value

This is the workflow that the Installer-Parity Rule exists for. Which branch you are on decides how much work it is:

| What you added | Installer work |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| A file under `client/Assets/` (icon, image, font) | **None** — the `AvaloniaResource` glob handles it |
| A change to `APP_IDENTIFIERS` / `VERSION` | **None** — embedded resource + script sourcing handle it |
| A script under `client/publish/` | **None** — `bundle_into_publish()` copies `publish/*.sh` and `*.iss` into every publish output |
| **Any other file the app reads at runtime** | Add the copy step to `bundle_into_publish()` in `build-installer.sh` **and** mirror it in `build-deb.sh`, `build-dmg.sh`, and `installer-windows.iss` — all four, together |
| A new env var or secret | Add it to `.env` **before** `encrypt-config.sh` runs. Installers ship a `config.enc` baked at build time; dev reads `.env` directly, so a var that works under `dotnet run` is silently missing in the installer |

**Path discipline (the rule `dotnet run` can never catch):** the installed app's working directory is root-owned and not user-writable. Never write relative to cwd or the exe directory. Logs and machine-id go to `~/.config/<package-name>/`; the database and sockets go to `~/.local/share/<package-name>/`.

---

## 5. Ship-test — the gate

```bash
cd client
bash publish/build-installer.sh -b linux     # or: win | mac | all
sudo dpkg -i installers/<package>_<version>_amd64.deb
```

What `build-installer.sh` does, in order: publishes each requested RID → **verifies every published `client.dll` is newer than every source file** (aborts otherwise) → bundles `publish/*.sh` and `*.iss` into each output → runs `encrypt-config.sh` and distributes `config.enc` → invokes the per-platform packager.

**If it aborts with "a source file is newer than the published client.dll":** the publish step did not pick up your latest source. `dotnet clean && bash publish/build-installer.sh`. Note the guard covers **compiled code only** — a missing asset, an unbundled script, an absent env var, or a bad path assumption will all sail past it. Those are yours to verify by hand.

**Then actually use the installed app.** Launch it from the desktop entry (not the build directory), click through the new functionality, close the window and confirm tracking survives, relaunch and confirm the single-instance handler raises the existing window instead of starting a second process.

**Packaging edits apply to all platforms.** If you touched one build script, check whether the other three need the same change before you stop.

---

## 6. Release

```bash
cd client
bash publish/release.sh            # tags v$(cat VERSION)
bash publish/release.sh v0.3.0     # or pin explicitly
```

It builds all platforms, commits, tags, pushes the tag, and creates (or replaces) the GitHub release with the artifacts attached — release title, notes and artifact names all derived from `APP_IDENTIFIERS` + `VERSION`. It requires the `gh` CLI to be authenticated; if the release step fails it prints the manual `gh release create` command to run.

Bump `VERSION` **before** releasing, and confirm §5 passed on at least one platform first — `release.sh` builds artifacts, it does not test them.

---

## 7. Cross-service changes

A change to what the client sends the server touches four places, in this order:

1. `server/migrations/0NN_<name>.sql` — new file, never an edit to an applied one
2. `server/internal/models/` + `dto/` — row shape, then wire shape
3. `server/internal/repository/new_schema_repo.go` → `services/new_schema_service.go` → `handlers/new_schema_handler.go` → route in `router/router.go` — the client-ingest path lives in the `new_schema_*` files, not the employee/user ones
4. `client/` — the collector or `Storage/SqliteLogStore.cs` shape, then the sync payload

Then the dashboard, if the data is meant to be visible: `web/src/lib/api.ts` first (it is the client-side contract), then the page under `web/src/app/(app)/`.

**Client and server ship independently.** An older installed client will keep POSTing the old shape for as long as it is in the field, so server changes must stay backward-compatible or be gated behind a version check.

## 8. Before you call it done

- [ ] Compiles: `dotnet build` / `make build` / `npm run build`
- [ ] For a client change: **installed and exercised from the installer**, not `dotnet run`
- [ ] New runtime files bundled in all four packaging paths, or confirmed covered by the `Assets/**` glob
- [ ] New env vars added to `.env` before `encrypt-config.sh`
- [ ] No hardcoded product names in detection logic — classification comes from OS metadata ([AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) §6)
- [ ] No new literal product name or version string — both come from `APP_IDENTIFIERS` / `VERSION`
- [ ] Docs updated when the structure moved: [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md), [client/ARCHITECTURE.md](./client/ARCHITECTURE.md), [client/UI_ARCHITECTURE.md](./client/UI_ARCHITECTURE.md), [FILE_HIERARCHY.md](./FILE_HIERARCHY.md)
